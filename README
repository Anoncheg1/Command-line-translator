news: There may be codepage error. New version of SpiderMonkey require (js -U) for working, but old version didn't work right with (-U) command line argument.

REQUIREMENTS: 
- UTF-8 support for required languages		For Debian: #dpkg-reconfigure locales
- curl >= 7.21.0
- SpiderMonkey >= Version: 17.0.8esr-2
- html2text for large texts
- mpg123 for playing pronunciation
For Debian: #apt-get install curl spidermonkey-bin html2text mpg123
- forvo.com account for pronunciation


FEATURES:
  - translated text,
  - fixed text with highlight,
  - language detection,
  - dictionary,
  - translit,
  - execution without parameters will translate fixed string for 1-2 words
for english: 
- phrases, ideom, transcription, audio pronunciation
- cache for words
- saving english words to file for learning

for convenience:
in ~/.bash_aliases
alias t="/home/user/translate"
alias ts="/home/user/translate -s"

You can force the language with environment varibles by command:
export TLSOURCE=en TLTARGET=ru
but better configure "FIRST_LANG" and "LATIN_LANG" in script for auto detection of direction by the first character!

for auto-Tab-completion:
in /etc/bash_completion.d/translate
# t completion
TR_ENG_WORDS="$HOME"/.translate/translated_words
have t &&
complete -W "$(cat $TR_ENG_WORDS)" t ts #autocompletion
